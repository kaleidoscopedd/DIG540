## DIG540: Digital Collections & Exhibitions
- Instructor: Craig Dietrich <https://craigdietrich.com>  
- Slack: DIG540, Fall 2022  

This course covers the technical means and social consequences of
assembling and sharing cultural data and artifacts. Topics include the
fundamentals of relational databases, a survey of collection management
packages and practices, and an introduction to the special concerns and
programming concepts necessary to customize off-the-shelf database
solutions for domain and content appropriateness.

Some of the text in this syllabus written by the previous instructor, John P. Bell <http://www.johnpbell.com>.

**Course Goals**

Upon completing the course, students will have:

- Been shown a variety of the collection management packages in use across
the field;
- Learned the fundamental structure and logic behind relational databases;
- Been introduced to concepts used in the PHP language to customize a CMS;
- Used data transformation tools to migrate collection data between formats;
- Gained an appreciation for the special source concerns of working with
cultural data in an information system.

**Required Materials**

Readings will be provided for you throughout the semester. No specific
text is needed.

**Course Site**

There are two main areas where you’ll find material related to the
course: GitHub and Slack.  
  
GitHub  
  
This course will use GitHub to distribute files, assignments, and even
this syllabus. You’ll also be turning your some of your work in using GitHub. GitHub
is a site that is often used to manage and distribute open source
software. It’s built on top of Git, a version control tool that you’re
going to see a lot of if you hang around software development circles. 
More details on how we’re going to use this tool are in the first
week’s video.  
  
Slack  
  
The course will be held on Slack, a popular online collaboration tool. 
Slack conversations take place in topical channels where messages are 
streamed in chronological order.  
  
**Course Flow**

The course is broken up into a series of topics that consist of video
lectures, readings, and associated assignments. Nominally each topic
takes one week, though you should expect some variation based on the
complexity of the material in the topic. New topics will begin on Wednesdays. 
For each topic you are expected to:

-   Watch all of the lectures and tutorials listed in the week’s
    introduction and read any assigned material;

-   Submit the assignment on GitHub (or as a link to another site
    or resource, as appropriate);

-   Participate in the ongoing discussions on Slack. It cannot be
    emphasized enough how important this is to successfully taking an
    online-only course. A significant part of what you get from the
    class will come in talking and listening to other students and the
    instructors as they discuss their own take on the material.

This course is designed to be completely asynchronous so there are no
specific times for meeting with other students or the instructor.

**Attendance Policy**

Attendance in an asynchronous online course is a somewhat nebulous
concept. While it is expected that you will accomplish all of the tasks
by their assigned deadlines, participation in the class' online
discussion is also critical to your success in the class and the
frequency and depth of your interactions with other students and the
instructor will be considered part of your “attendance” and thus part of
your grade. If you for any reason think you may have an issue, either
on a specific day/week or overall, talk to us! It is much easier to make
accommodations ahead of time than after the fact.

**Participation**

If the only time you post a comment is when you're turning in an
assignment then you will have little opportunity to display your
understanding of the ideas being discussed and we will not have much
information to use when evaluating your success in the class. Ask
questions, throw in comments, and generally add to the discussion as
much as possible. Odds are other people are as confused as you
are.

**Grading**

Grading for your assignments is
weighted equally across each week of the class. 

Participation is a significant part of your grade. The more you add
thoughtful, insightful comments to the discussion the more both you and
other students will benefit. Note, though, that does not mean you need
to write a carefully considered treatise in order to contribute! Stream
environments like Slack work best with shorter, more back-and-forth
discussions. Questions are always welcome and should be asked publicly
so that everybody can see the answer unless there is a very good reason
to ask privately. In many cases you will be expected to look at and
critique other students’ work as an absolute minimum level of
participation.

This is a graduate level course and you are expected to perform
accordingly. Meeting the requirements in an average manner will result
in a "C" as the final grade. Better than average effort and execution
will result in a "B". An "A" is reserved for those students who
demonstrate exceptional creative development, application, innovation,
effort, and an in-depth understanding of process. Under normal
circumstances a C or lower grade cannot be used as a graduate student to
count towards completion of your certificate. Failure to complete any of
the required components of your grade with an average or better effort
will result in a "D" or an "F" as your final grade.

**Topics**

*Topic 1: Virtual Collections*

Collecting information on artifacts is only the first half of the
responsibility of cultural preservation and cataloging institutions;
they must also work to keep that information alive and share it with
researchers and the public. In a digital context, methods of sharing
data can range from an internal database made available to other
institutional staff to a public website designed for dissemination.

*Topic 2: Database Structures*

Understanding how data is stored helps understand how the storage medium
and mechanism influences the representation of an artifact. Databases structures 
are introduced and common tools used in their creation and manipulatio are demonstrated.

*Topic 3: Publishing Data on the Web*

Databases are rarely exposed directly to the Internet, and for most
people would be largely useless if they were. Intermediary languages
take on the role of formatting data for output and passing data input
from the interface to the database.

*Topic 4: Merging Data and Logic*

In order to be useful, web interfaces and databases need to be connected
together. Basic programming techniques are demonstrated that 
are used to insert, access, and display database information on web
sites.

**University Policies**

1)  **Academic Honesty Statement:** Academic honesty is very important.
    It is dishonest to cheat on exams, to copy term papers, to submit
    papers written by another person, to fake experimental results, or
    to copy or reword parts of books or articles into your own papers
    without appropriately citing the source. Students committing or
    aiding in any of these violations may be given failing grades for an
    assignment or for an entire course, at the discretion of the
    instructor. In addition to any academic action taken by an
    instructor, these violations are also subject to action under the
    University of Maine Student Conduct Code. The maximum possible
    sanction under the student conduct code is dismissal from the
    University.

2)  **Students with disabilities statement:** If you have a disability 
    for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact 
    Student Accessibility Services, 121 East Annex, 581.2319, as early 
    as possible in the term. Students who have already been approved 
    for accommodations by SAS and have a current accommodation letter 
    should meet with me (the instructor of the course) privately as 
    soon as possible.

3)  **Course Schedule Disclaimer (Disruption Clause):** In the event of
    an extended disruption of normal classroom activities, the format
    for this course may be modified to enable its completion within its
    programmed time frame. In that event, you will be provided an
    addendum to the syllabus that will supersede this version.

4)  **Sexual Discrimination Reporting:** The University of Maine is
    committed to making campus a safe place for students. Because of
    this commitment, if you tell a teacher about an experience of
    **sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, relationship abuse
    (dating violence and domestic violence), sexual misconduct or any
    form of gender discrimination** involving members of the campus,
    **your teacher is required to report** this information to the
    campus Office of Sexual Assault & Violence Prevention or the Office
    of Equal Opportunity.

-    *If you want to talk in confidence* to someone about an
    experience of sexual discrimination, please contact these resources:
