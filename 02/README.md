## Week 2 - Data Curation

Now we'll look more closely at the vocabulary file we created last week, turning it into a data feed. Then we'll use our hosting accounts to make a web page out of the feed.

**Assignment**

All parts of the assignment are discussed in the intro video above.

Part 1: Upstream sync your DIG540 repository with the main repository.

Part 2: Read the short blog post *What are the important differences between DAM and CMS?* by Casey Schmidt: <https://www.canto.com/blog/dam-vs-cms/>.

Part 3: In Slack's #dam-cms channel, write a blurb about a Digital Asset Management or Content Management System that you are familiar with, and how it is being used by you or others. Be critical of the software if lacks certain features, or glowing about it if it meets your needs. If you don't see the #dam-cms channel in Slack, DM Craig to get invited there.

Part 4: Create a simple dynamic web page based on the "vocabulary.json" data feed:
- Locate "vocabulary.json" in your DIG540 repository;
- Locate the 'raw' feed of "vocabulary.json" by following the "raw" button, make note of the URL;
- In Visual Studio Code, create vocabulary.php and save to your local filesystem;
- Edit the new vocabulary.php file with the code from the video (the video will show each line of the code written by hand... it'll provide good practice to follow along line by line, but I'll also paste the completed code block to Slack);
- Upload vocabulary.php to your Reclaim hosting account;
- Once uploaded, find your new web page at **[your domain name]/vocabulary.php**, and paste this new URL into Slack's #general channel;

Congrats, you've made your first dynamic web page! 

If you run into any problems, make sure to ask questions on Slack!

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 14th.**
